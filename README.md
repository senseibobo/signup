This was a game we made for MET Game Hackathon 2022. It won us 1st place. :)<br>
It's about trying your best to sign up and log into a website. This would be easy if the bizarre forms of CAPTCHA it uses didn't exist.<br>
Features:
- The game looks like a stylized browser window with fully functioning fullscreen and exit buttons.
- Password strength checker (a bit of an excessive one)
- Many minigames in the form of CAPTCHAs
- One of them is 3D

This was my second ever game jam. I took all the things that I've learned from the first hackathon and the first jam I've been and it looks like it paid off :)<br>
